\subsection{Parameter estimation codes}
This subsection includes an overview of publicly available codes to calculate the likelihood.

\subsubsection{Wish list definition}

The basic requirement for codes which obtain cosmological predictions from Boltzmann codes and perform parameter estimation is ``modularity''.\\
A modular code is easy to modify in case some changes and updates need to be included, e.g. additional likelihoods, extra parameters, correction to observables (systematics).\\
Furthermore, separate modules for different physical quantities are needed for the atomistic approach as they allow to easily retrieve and compute the intermediate quantities of the theory
flows (see e.g. Fig. \ref{WLtomo}) and to compare them between different codes.\\
However too much modularity may affect code performances.\\

The wish list of modules is:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item module calling the Boltzmann/transfer function codes for primary science
 \item module calling the sampler
 \item module for each likelihood for each probe
 \item module for background quantities
 \item module for perturbation quantities
 \item module for non-linear corrections (ex. halofit)
 \item module that gets the standard output from Boltzmann codes and produces list of suitable output
 \item postprocessing of the samples
 \item plotting modules 
 \item module for cross correlation of probes
\end{enumerate}

In the following, the publicly available codes are listed, together with the requirements which are satisfied by each of them. The missed requirements are also listed and the complexity 
of implementation is indicated as easy (E), medium (M) and difficult (D).

\newpage
\subsubsection{COSMOMC}

\begin{itemize}
\item SN: JLA, Union
\item CMB+CMB Lensing: Planck, WMAP, BICEP2+Keck
\item LSS: WiggleZ, SDSS LRG, CFHTLenS
\item BAO+RSD: several (noticeably BOSS)
\item HST H0 measurements
\item SZ CLUSTER: Planck
\end{itemize}

{\it \bf Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item updated constantly
 \item very well tested, very efficient for standard cosmology

 \item Likelihood Sampler works really well
\end{itemize}

{\it \bf Cons: }
\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Recommendation on codes and coding languages to use}

\subsubsection{Coding Language}
The SGS use python and C++ only, and it would be good for us to follow them to have some coherence. Although there are pros and cons.\\
It would be ideal to have a python infrastructure: wrappers in python to other codes written in different open sources free languages (instead of IDL, Mathematica)\\
FR software to convert languages from one to another: help to write a python wrapper, for example SDC is using swig (http://www.swig.org/).
Good experience with SWIG, it serves as a way of passing data between python and other languages (Bjoern: tried out python$\rightarrow$C with openMP-parallelisation)\\
Make sure all libraries used/needed are available. 
SDC already has a list of libraries that are allowed to be used, at \url{http://euclid.roe.ac.uk/projects/codeen-users/wiki/EDEN}.
Python slow for high level performances. 

\subsubsection{Boltzmann code}

No specific choice, but recommendation is that we need at least 2 codes that match for each model (match in the sense explained in the methodology below); 
in addition, our recommendation is to use MGCAMB only for tests (and clearly specify limitations of the code and assumptions in it).


\subsubsection{Parameter estimation and likelihood code map}
A summary of how the likelihood codes compare to the wish list is visualised in Fig.\ref{ISTcodemap}. MontePython is at present the code that includes the highest number of requirements in the wish list. JL \& team within Euclid guarantee fast 
update for wrappers to Boltzmann code version updates and to new data which become available. \\
\textcolor{red}{To be discussed: how the different codes perform on cross correlation of probes.}

\subsubsection{Analysis and visualization}
Getdist and plotting tools provided by cosmomc.

\subsection{Methodology to test a code}

\subsubsection{How to trust a Boltzmann code in Modified Gravity}

For every MG model, there should be at least 2 Boltzmann codes, agreeing. Agreement is defined as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item check them on LCDM, need to agree at less than 0.1\%
 \item check them in a MG scenario in different ranges of parameters: they should match at the same level at which they agree in LCDM on 
all background quantities, all perturbation quantities, all spectra
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{How to trust a likelihood code}
The code needs to pass a self-consistency check: use a simulation to produce a set of data and check if you can recover the initial cosmological model.\\
Available simulations: \\
galaxy mock catalogue
\begin{enumerate}
 \item from MICE simulations (HOD) in LCDM cosmology  \url{http://internal.euclid-ec.org/?page_id=1551}
 \item from Durham simulations (SAM) in LCDM cosmology 
\end{enumerate}
Needed:
\begin{itemize}
 \item simulations from non-standard cosmological models: e.g. f(R), DE 
 \item simulations with neutrinos
 \item mock catalogue for WL (to be asked to the WL splinter-2)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Input from other groups}
\subsubsection{SGS}
We need to define the infrastructure of the code pipeline with SGS (\url{http://euclid.roe.ac.uk/projects/sgssu/wiki}), see infrastructure channel on SLACK.
\comment{Contacted Marc Savage}


\subsubsection{Splinter-2}
List of requirements that the ideal CosmoBox code should provide, as for weak lensing.

\paragraph{Specific inputs}
Tomographic redshift distribution, with errors, outlier distributions
Optional: observational effects such as masks
\paragraph{The signal}
Non-linear matter power spectrum down to k ~ 50 h/Mpc (that is where the FoM saturates, Kitching $\&$ Taylor 2011; to model uncertainties in that highly non-linear regime we would then add parameters with certain priors).
Baryonic effects on power spectrum (not clear yet how this should best be implemented) 
Lensing projections: Standard WL power spectrum approximations, optional: second-order corrections
Optional: real-space lensing correlations
\paragraph{Errors}
Gaussian covariance, optional: non-Gaussian covariance
\paragraph{Systematics}
Intrinsic alignment power spectra
Nuisance parameters (e.g. shear biases)

\paragraph{Specific outputs}
Lensing tomographic power spectra, optional: split into different contributions (IA, with/without systematics) for testing


\subsubsection{Splinter-3}

\subsubsection{Splinter-4}

\subsubsection{TWG}
For each model in the parameter definition document (PDD), the TWG provides a table \ref{TWGcodemap} with the following information: Model, code, availability, Reference, Contact person.
